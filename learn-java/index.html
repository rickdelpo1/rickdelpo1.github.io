Learn Java, why do we want to do this in 2021                               by Rick Delpo      11-26-21
</p>
<p>
Learn Java because we appear more sophisticated
</p>
<p>
Learn Java because there is money to be made
</p>
<p>
Learn Java and have it in your tool box
</p>
<p>
Learn Java because other languages use similar syntax
</p>
<p>
Learn Java to become more well rounded
</p>
<p>
Become Full Stack by Learning Java along with SQL and Javascript
</p>
<p>
My old school java tutorials can be found <a href="https://howtolearnjava.com"> here.</a>
</p>
<p>
Note a couple of things. I am instructing all on a Windows platform. U will be redirected to our <a href="https://javasqlweb.org"> parent site </a> for now because this site is still under construction
</p>
<p>
Also using only Eclipse as my IDE and u, the beginner, should move on to Eclipse with Maven quickly because most of the tutorials out there are in Maven. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I am providing ONLY the very basics and it is up to u to keep the research going at ur own pace. My java tutorials are only a small piece of the puzzle.
</p>
<p>
So by all means, please do Learn Java, u will not regret it.
</p>
<p>
Happy Coding !!

var hit1 = "7";  //in tracker db hit is a string..i think all fields are strings in tracker db
            //for new db we can keep this constant so we can sort the db by hit to get most recent hits ie hit=3 not 1

var now = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
var out = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();

passVars();  //run passVars here, then on each pg click run passVars again to capture pg name

  function passVars() {

   //then pass 5 objects... ses, hit2 etc to lambda and call event.ses inside lambda..note, must be called article
const article = { ses: session, city2: city, hit2: date, date2:pg_name, ip2:ip_address,country2:country, time2:now, time3:out };

//need to replace saveS3 with lodash2 for test...also pass real vars to lodash 2 instead of mock data
//API endpoint: https://d38pchcrt4.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/default/lodash2
        
      .then(res => {
        //console.log(res.data);
      });
   //note, this axios runs on page load to do time in on db...all other axios on this page by button press only
         //this axios post should not run again on back press or when menu items are pressed

//this axios is for user time in....see onpopstate for time out
